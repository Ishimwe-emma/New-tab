# New-tab
This is just a new tab that is displayed instead of chrome's default tab
To anyone who wants to use this custom tab he or she will have to go in the html and remove a name 'ISHIMWE THRAY' and add his or her name. He or she will
also have to add a chrome extension called "Custom New Tab URL"
